Final assigment for the Practical Machine Learning Course
There are various models trained to predict a type of movement measured with various accelerometer. Just look at the html report *"final_PML.html"* to see the comparison between the models.
Additionally there are a .Rmd file with the R markdown code to generate the html report and .RDS file with the final model selected, as well as the training dataset used in the .csv file.
